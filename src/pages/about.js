						<h2>Project Description</h2>
						<p>
							This project focuses on developing open-source tools for a digital academic library. Our primary goal is
							to facilitate the distribution of documents in a manner that is both easy and legally compliant.
							The project began during the COVID-19 pandemic to help students access study materials in a centralized
							and legal way. It continues to be an important resource for students and educators alike.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through this initiative, we aim to create a reliable platform that supports the educational needs of our
							academic community. The tools we develop are maintained by a dedicated team of students and PhD
							candidates, ensuring ongoing improvements and updates.
